LAB2.cct
This file is the test circuit for the lab to test each circuit together and individually. 

ECC GENERATOR.cct
This file-circuit accepts a 8 Bit input and generates a 12 bit output with 4 parity bits.

DATA Transmission.cct
The Data Transmission simulates real world data errors. This circuits allows a single bit error to occur and is
passed onto the Main Memory.

Main Memory.cct
The Main Memory's function is to accept the data passed by the data transmission circuit and performs its 
subcircuits function. It outputs an code to let the user know if no error has occurred (0) or if a single bit
error has occurred (C). 

4-Bit Encoder.cct
This 4-Bit encoder is a sub-circuit of the Main memory. Its only function is to accept the 12 Bit Data and then 
encodes it to a 4 bit ECC CODE.

4-to-12 Bit Decoder.cct
This circuit is also another sub-circuit of the Main Memory. Its function is to decode the 4-Bit ECC code
and fixes any occurance of single bit errors.
