Design Process
I started with a state diagram, using the mealy model. I used the mealy model beacuse I can design
the system with states including input value of x. There are 8 States for each bit and remembered bits, 
and a 9th state to remember the whole 8 bits. Using a a state table and 5 variable Karnaugh map
I was able to determine the optimize equations for each of the next states for each flip flop (A-D). A being
MSB and D being LSB.
